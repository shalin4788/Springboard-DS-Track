# Capstone Project # 1

**About**

Big Mountain Resort, who has recently installed an additional chair lift to increase distribution of visitors across the mountain has resulted in the operating costs increasing by $1,540,000 this season. The resort investors are looking for a solution to increase this yearâ€™s annual revenue in the form of more footfalls to offset the increasing operating costs keeping in mind that it faces tough competition from nearly 330 resorts in the US.

**Tools and Editors**

- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda Prompt

**Libraries**

- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

**Data Wrangling**

1) Data cleansing was performed primarily focusing on the following
-	Handling the missing and NA values
-	Removing duplicate rows 

2) Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to find co-relation between variables

**Training data set development, Model development and selection**

Using Linear Regression and performance metrics to identify the best possibility model in order to: 

a) Improve Explained variance 

b) Reduce Mean Absolute Error

Using KMeans Clustering and scatter plots to convey findings of co-relation coefficients and model performance metrics

**Sequence of steps followed**

# Step 1 - Problem identification
# Step 2 - Data Wrangling
