These are Capstone projects, case studies, projects and tutorials completed for the Springboard Data Science Career Track (April 2020 Cohort).

# Springboard repo

## Libraries 
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tweepy, Requests, json, BeautifulSoup, NLTK

## Capstone projects involved
**Capstone 1** - Applied Linear Regression and KMeans clustering models, built training data set and applied to test data set (i.e. the resort (in scope) in the dataframe looking to increase revenues to offset against the increased CAPEX it incurred this year) to determine the performance metrics like Pearson Coeffient and finally, predict the ticket pricing it should target.

**Capstone 2** - Quora Insensitive questions to facilitate constructive community and forum discussion, weeding out insincere, malinformed, fake and unhealthy content. Performed 1) Data Wrangling 2) EDA 3) Feature Engineering 4) Machine Learning Algorithm applications

## Projects involved
**API mini project** - Used Quandl API to create developer API credentials to build a json file and further, performed computations in order to determine stock prices and trading volumes.

## Case Studies involved
**London housing Case Study** - Used pandas librarires and functions to see the trend of housing market in London metropolitan areas.

**SQL Country Club case study** - Used SQL intermediate concepts like joins, case statements, sub queries, windows functions etc. to solve different questions asked as a part of the project. 

**Frequentist Case Study** - Apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data and has concepts like Central Limit theorem, bootstrapping and Hypothesis testing.

**Integrating with Apps Case Study (Preview of what to expect in ML modeling)**
- Sourcing and loading data
- Cleaning, transforming and visualizing data
- Modeling
  - Hypothesis formulation
  - Getting distribution of data
  - Permutation test
- Evaluating models

**Calculating distances - Case Study**
- Euclidean distance
- Manhattan distance

**Cosine similarity calculations - Case Study**
- To measure distance, similarity measurements w.r.t orientation rather than magnitude

**Regression Models - Case Studies**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

**Classification Models - Case Studies**
- KMeans algorithm
- Decision Tree classifier model
- Random Forest ensemble model
- Gradient Boosting model
- Grid search in KNN
